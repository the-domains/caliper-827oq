  Returning to Helena for the first time after the Atlantic crossing was lovely.
  The boat felt like home immediately. Thought when the opportunity arose, I did
  not go sleep in the bow cabin, but upgraded more to the center. I was not
  ready to handle the recollection of the stale air and the roller coaster ride
  of the Atlantic swell.
